# Portfolio Transformation Strategy: Senior Engineering Leader Positioning

## Executive Summary

Transform Chad Gauthier's portfolio from individual contributor positioning to senior engineering leader with 10+ years of measurable business impact across enterprise, finance, and high-growth startup environments.

## Current State Analysis

### Critical Gaps Identified:
- **Messaging Hierarchy Mismatch**: Content positions as passionate IC rather than seasoned engineering leader
- **Missing Achievement Quantification**: No prominent display of impressive metrics (80% build time reduction, 10x database performance)
- **Incomplete Leadership Narrative**: Limited emphasis on team mentoring, project ownership, strategic decisions
- **Technology Stack Outdated**: Missing AI/ML systems, GraphQL, modern performance optimization
- **Projects Page Underdeveloped**: Empty content instead of end-to-end project ownership showcase
- **CV Structure**: Task-level details rather than leadership progression and business impact
