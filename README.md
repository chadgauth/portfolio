# Astro About | Chad Gauthier Portfolio

Astro is a modern front-end framework for building fast, optimized websites. It allows you to write components using your favorite UI framework (or none at all), and then compiles away to efficient, static HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This results in faster load times and a better user experience.

Astro's key benefits include:

- Content-driven: Astro is designed for building content-rich websites, making it an excellent choice for blogs, portfolios, and e-commerce sites.
- Server-first: Astro leverages server-rendering over client-side rendering as much as possible, which can lead to improved performance.
- Zero-JS by default: Astro only sends the necessary JavaScript to the client, resulting in faster load times.
- UI-agnostic: Astro supports multiple UI frameworks, allowing you to use the one you're most comfortable with or even mix and match within a single project.

## About This Project

In my project, you're exploring micro-frontends and integrating Astro with Alpine.js and React.

- React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces, particularly single-page applications.
- Alpine.js: A minimal framework for composing JavaScript behavior in your markup. It offers the reactive and declarative nature of big frameworks like Vue or React at a much lower cost.
- Radix UI: An open-source UI component library for building high-quality, accessible design systems and web apps.
- Shoelace: A forward-thinking library of web components. It works with all frameworks, and it's built with lit, making it lightweight and highly customizable.
- OKLCH: A new color format that you're using, which is top-notch.
